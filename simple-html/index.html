        <h3>Chainsaw man</h3>
        <p> 
            I start reading this because the name reminds me of some super heroes and the author wrote "Fire punch".
            I just think that this would be a wild ride given what the title is and how interesting "Fire punch" is. 
            The manga starts of pretty decent with ok jokes about some weird stuffs but the world building seems
            to be interesting. The adventure actually starts around chapter 40, when you realize that this was not a 
            comedy manga but an action one. The situations that the authors put our main authors through is just 
            mind-blowing. All the hurdles that he has to overcome seems so close to every day problems but in a world
            that fills with madness, it is completely different. Sometimes it feels a bit weird but if you are looking 
            to try out some new manga genres, this might be for you. 
        </p>

        <h3>Kimetsu no Yaiba</h3>
        <p> 
            This is your typical adventure manga I would say but the action and the stories behind are so good that I
            really recommend. The main character starts of with the intention to avenge his family (typical manga's
            protagonist start). He was dissapproved at first by the Demon's Slayer but as he goes through many trials 
            and difficulties, he prove himself to be a competent one. The thing that is special about this manga is every
            characters have a detailed backstory that you can relate to on some levels. Even when the protagonist kills 
            the final boss, it was a joint effort of multiple characters. 
        </p>

        <h3>Grand Blue</h3>
        <p>
            I have no word to describe this except that it is a very special type of comedy manga. The jokes are very 
            different but when you start to think like the characters, the laugh will start kicking in. It is not for
            everyone so gives it a shot and read about 5 chapters.
